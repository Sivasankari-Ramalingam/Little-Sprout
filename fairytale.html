                  <p><strong>He knew he was the best. He knew he was everyone’s favorite guy. </strong></p>
                  <p>You may think this tale as old as time has been told before.
                    You may know about the Beauty, and the Beast, and the curse they broke together. But some stories have more than one ending. Some stories have more than one villain.</p>

                  <p>Such is the story of Gaston. Growing up, young Gaston and the prince were brothers in all but blood. Their boyhood adventures led them throughout the many rooms of the castle, and into the deep woods beyond. The woods that were home to the legendary Beast of G?vaudan, a terrifying creature whose presence loomed larger than life in their imaginations.</p>

                  <p>Then one fateful night, a violent tragedy changed their lives–and their friendship–forever, setting each of them down a very different path: the first, of greed and entitlement, the second, of determination to right the wrongs of the past.</p>

                  <p><strong>A girl with dangerous magic makes a risky bargain with a demon to be free of her monstrous power in this “dark, devastating, and gothic” (Kirkus Reviews) young adult fantasy perfect for fans of An Enchantment of Ravens and House of Salt and Sorrows. </strong></p>
                  <p>Liska knows that magic is monstrous, and its practitioners are monsters. She has done everything possible to suppress her own magic, to disastrous consequences. Desperate to be free of it, Liska flees her small village and delves into the dangerous, demon-inhabited spirit-wood to steal a mythical fern flower. If she plucks it, she can use its one wish to banish her powers. Everyone who has sought the fern flower has fallen prey to unknown horrors, so when Liska is caught by the demon warden of the wood–called The Leszy–a bargain seems better than death: one year of servitude in exchange for the fern flower and its wish.</p>

                  <p>Whisked away to The Leszy’s crumbling manor, Liska soon makes an unsettling discovery: she is not the first person to strike this bargain, and all her predecessors have mysteriously vanished. If Liska wants to survive the year and return home, she must unravel her taciturn host’s spool of secrets and face the ghosts–figurative and literal–of his past. Because something wakes in the woods, something deadly and without mercy. It frightens even The Leszy…and cannot be defeated unless Liska embraces the monster she’s always feared becoming.</p>

                  <p><strong>A best-selling author and an award-winning illustrator join forces in a long-form picture book that turns a familiar myth of Irish folklore into a universal story of love, perseverance, and friendship against all odds. </strong></p>
                  <p>Banshees are well known to most of us as supernatural Irish harbingers of doom. But not many know that they grow on the prickly gorse bush inside little pods, and that the sole job of a baby banshee, or “bansheenie,” is to bond with a human and know all there is to know about that person, including when they’re destined to breathe their last breath. One bansheenie named Beanie, however, is no ordinary herald of death. </p>

                  <p>When she sees her person, a little girl named Rose, she decides to change both their fates–and instead of delivering bad news, protect Rose and her family. And when her banshee’s howl won’t work, she must draw power and strength from the ancient secrets and hidden networks of the natural world to create a new sound, a new way of being in the world, that will change everything. Melding Eoin Colfer’s welcoming voice and Steve McCarthy’s striking Celtic imagery, Beanie the Bansheenie is a gloriously immersive, detailed, and emotional storytelling experience.</p>

                  <p><strong>The 12th installment in the New York Times best-selling series asks: What if Rapunzel’s mother drank a potion from the wrong flower?</strong></p>
                  <p>Desperate to save the life of their queen and her unborn child, the good citizens of the kingdom comb the land for the all-healing Sundrop flower to cure her . . . but someone mistakenly picks the blossom of the Moondrop instead. This shimmering flower heals the queen and she delivers a healthy baby girl–with hair as silver and gray as the moon. </p>

                  <p>But with her mysterious hair comes dangerous magical powers: the power to hurt, not heal. For the safety of the kingdom, Rapunzel is locked away in a tower and put under the care of the powerful goodwife, Mother Gothel.</p>

                  <p>For eighteen years Rapunzel stays imprisoned in her tower, knowing she must protect everyone from her magical hair. When she finally decides to leave the only home she’s ever known–to see the floating lights that appear on her birthday–she gets caught up in an unexpected adventure with two thieves: a would-be outlaw named Gina, and Flynn Rider, a rogue on the run. </p>

                  <p>The Darkling rules from his shadow throne while a weakened Alina Starkov recovers from their battle under the dubious protection of the zealots who worship her as a Saint.

To win this fight, she must seize a legend’s power–but claiming the firebird may be her ruin.</p>

                  <p><strong>Bestselling author Ava Reid makes her YA debut in this dark academic fantasy perfect for fans of Melissa Albert and Elana K. Arnold.</strong></p>
                  <p>Effy Sayre has always believed in fairy tales. Haunted by visions of the Fairy King since childhood, she’s had no choice. Her tattered copy of Angharad–Emrys Myrddin’s epic about a mortal girl who falls in love with the Fairy King, then destroys him–is the only thing keeping her afloat. So when Myrddin’s family announces a contest to redesign the late author’s estate, Effy feels certain it’s her destiny.</p>

                  <p>But musty, decrepit Hiraeth Manor is an impossible task, and its residents are far from welcoming. Including Preston H?loury, a stodgy young literature scholar determined to expose Myrddin as a fraud. As the two rivals piece together clues about Myrddin’s legacy, dark forces, both mortal and magical, conspire against them–and the truth may bring them both to ruin.</p>

                  <p>Part historical fantasy, part rivals-to-lovers romance, part Gothic mystery, and all haunting, dreamlike atmosphere, Ava Reid’s powerful YA debut will lure in readers who loved The Atlas Six, House of Salt and Sorrows, or Girl, Serpent, Thorn. </p>
